# Crash-Alram-Net
Private Project to detect car crash 

Barak Or and Yaniv Hassidoff. 


Main Mile-stones:
0. Finding a great database of cars and their respective distance. 
1. Creating CNN architecture with car image input and their respective camera to car distance as an output
2. Calculating velocity from a series of images (same car) if available, to detect crash potential  
3. One POC: a sereis of images-> crash ?
4. Paper objectives:
  a. At least three (CNN) architectures
  b. math description
  c. "Convolutional" justification
